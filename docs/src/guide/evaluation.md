# Performance evaluation using Langfuse

If you wish to use [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) for performance evaluation then set `EVAL_USE_LANGFUSE = "True"` in the `.env` file followed by `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_URL`. You can set these up by running Langfuse self-hosted or by signing up and signing in to [the Langfuse cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/).
