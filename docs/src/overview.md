# Too Long, Didn't Read, Let's Chat (TLDRLC)

Too Long Didn't Read Let's Chat (TLDRLC) is a chatbot prototype that allows users to chat with a _large language model (LLM)_ about various data sources. This chatbot utilises _retrieval augmented generation (RAG)_ with _knowledge graph_ and _semantic search_.

TLDRLC is an experimental software. It is not associated with any, and should not be interpreted as a, reliable chatbot service. The rationale behind this project is experimentation with retrieval augmented generation. The implementation is based on concepts from publicly available information, including tutorials and courses, such as [DeepLearning.ai: Knowledge Graphs for RAG](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/knowledge-graphs-rag/) and [DeepLearning.ai: Building and Evaluating Advanced RAG](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-evaluating-advanced-rag/) to name a few.
