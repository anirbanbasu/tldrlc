# Too Long, Didn't Read, Let's Chat (TLDRLC)

Too Long Didn't Read Let's Chat (TLDRLC) is a chatbot prototype that allows a user to chat with a _large language model (LLM)_ about various data sources. This chatbot utilises _retrieval augmented generation (RAG)_ backed by _knowledge graph_ and _semantic search_ indices.

To read the project documentation, install [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and run `mdbook serve docs/`, which will make the web-based documentation available at http://localhost:3000/.
